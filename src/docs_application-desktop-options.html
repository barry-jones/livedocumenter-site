<h4>Build Configuration</h4>

<p>The build configuration allows you to select between Release and Debug. This is only relevant when reading documentation 
    from a Visual Studio project or solution. This will direct the application to look in the Release or Debug folders 
    respectively for libraries and XML comment files.</p>

<h4>Syntax Language</h4>

<p>This allows you to configure which syntax is displayed in the documentation pane. Currently you can choose between C# and
     VB.NET. After changing this option and navigating around the project you will see that the syntax blocks display 
    in the selected language.</p>

<h4>Visibility filter</h4>

<p>The visibility filter controls which members and types are displayed in the documentation based on their access modifiers.
     You can choose a minimum of just public (public is always displayed and can't be changed) and one or more of the following.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Internal</li>
    <li>Private</li>
    <li>Protected</li>
    <li>Protected internal</li>
</ul>

<p>After clicking `accept` the documentation will be updated to display only those types and members which match your criteria.</p>
