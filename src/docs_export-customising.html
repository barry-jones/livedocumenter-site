<h2>Customising the output</h2>

<p>All of the LDEC files shipped with the Live Documenter can be customised simply by unzipping the contents 
    of the LDEC file to a directory and modifying the CSS. When zipped up again and placed in the ApplicationData
     folder these will be available in the export dialogue.</p>

<p>More complicated customisation of the output will require a broader knowledge of the file and it's 
    contents which can be found <a href="/export/live-documenter-export-configuration-files">here</a>.</p>

<p>After unzipping the file you will see the following structure:</p>
<pre>
styles/
styles/default.css
styles/images/...
export.config
screenshot.png
webexport.xslt
</pre>
<p>If you make all your changes in the <code>styles/default.css</code> file, you can control the look and feel of the output
    and no futher modifications will be required.</p>
